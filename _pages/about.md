I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Harvard University. My research interests are primarily in econometrics with a focus on causal inference in dynamic settings, and questions of algorithmic fairness and discrimination in data-driven decision making.

I am on the job market in 2021-2022. If you'd like to learn more about me, you can find my CV [here][asheshr-cv].

If you'd like to contact me, please send me an email at asheshr@g.harvard.edu.
