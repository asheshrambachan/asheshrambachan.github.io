Welcome to my homepage!

I'm a post-doctoral researcher at Microsoft Research New England. In 2023, I'll be joining MIT's economics department as an assistant professor.

My research interests are primarily in theoretical and applied econometrics with a focus on causal inference and data-driven decision-making. I develop methods for robust causal inference in cross-sectional and dynamic settings. I study algorithmic fairness and transparency in data-driven decision-making with a particular focus on the use of algorithmic tools in the criminal justice system and consumer lending markets.

If you'd like to learn more about me, you can find my CV [here][asheshr-cv].

If you'd like to contact me, please send me an email at asheshr at mit.edu
