Welcome to my homepage!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Harvard University, where I am advised by [iandrews][Isaiah Andrews], [smullainathan][Sendhil Mullainathan], [nshephard][Neil Shephard], and [etamer][Elie Tamer]. My research interests are primarily in theoretical and applied econometrics. I study causal inference and identification in dynamic settings. I use econometrics and economic theory to analyze questions of algorithmic fairness and discrimination in machine learning and data-driven decision making. 

*I am on the job market in AY 2021-2022.* 

If you'd like to learn more about me, you can find my CV [here][asheshr-cv].

If you'd like to contact me, please send me an email at asheshr@g.harvard.edu.
