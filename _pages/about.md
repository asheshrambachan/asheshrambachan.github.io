Welcome to my homepage!

I'm an assistant professor in MIT's economics department.

My research interests are primarily in theoretical and applied econometrics with a focus on applications of machine learning in economics and causal inference. I develop methods for robust causal inference in cross-sectional and dynamic settings. I study algorithmic fairness and transparency in data-driven decision-making with a particular focus on the use of algorithmic tools in the criminal justice system and consumer lending markets.

If you'd like to learn more about me, you can find my CV [here][asheshr-cv].
