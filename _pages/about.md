I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Harvard University. My research interests are primarily in econometrics with a focus on causal inference in dynamic settings, and questions surrounding algorithmic fairness and discrimination. If you'd like to learn more about me, you can find my CV [here][asheshr-cv].
