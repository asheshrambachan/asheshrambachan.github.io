Welcome to my homepage!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Harvard University, where I am advised by [Isaiah Andrews][iandrews], [Sendhil Mullainathan][smullainathan], [Neil Shephard][nshephard], and [Elie Tamer][etamer]. 

My research interests are primarily in theoretical and applied econometrics. I use econometrics to analyze questions of algorithmic fairness and discrimination in machine learning and data-driven decision making. I develop methods for robust causal inference in cross-sectional and dynamic settings that enable researchers to interpret existing statistical methods when their assumptions fail, and use domain-specific knowledge to credibly estimate causal effects.

**I am on the job market in AY 2021-2022.** 

If you'd like to learn more about me, you can find my CV [here][asheshr-cv].

If you'd like to contact me, please send me an email at asheshr@g.harvard.edu.
